      'Starting where resiliency leaves off, a psychology researcher and a journalist explore the science of remarkable accomplishment in the wake of trauma.',
      'Over four billion people worldwide will survive a trauma during their lives. Some will experience severe post-traumatic stress. Most will eventually recover and return to life as normal. But sometimes, survivors do more than bounce back. Sometimes they bounce forward.',
      'These are the supersurvivors—individuals who not only rebuild their lives, but also thrive and grow in ways never previously imagined. David B. Feldman and Lee Daniel Kravetz look beyond the tenets of traditional psychology for a deeper understanding of the strength of the human spirit. What they find is often counterintuitive—how certain delusions can be healthy, why forgiveness may be good for the body as well as the soul, and why reflecting on death can lead to a better life. The authors interviewed dozens of men and women whose stories serve as the counterpoint to the latest scientific findings. Feldman and Kravetz weave these extraordinary narratives with the research, creating an emotionally compelling and thought-provoking look at what is possible in the face of human tragedy. Supersurvivors will reset our thinking about how we deal with challenges, no matter how big or small.',

      "People are living with severe medical conditions for greater periods of time than ever before. It's not surprising that family caregivers feel unprepared to face the choices they must inevitably make.",

      "Advanced technology has afforded people the opportunity to live with severe medical conditions for greater periods of time than ever in history. People may be told that they have a life-threatening disease a year or more in advance of passing away. A side effect of this reality is that patients and their families are facing unprecedented choices about how and where the death will occur. They often must choose between treatments that may extend life but cause significant side effects and hospice care that focuses on comfort but may mean foregoing other treatments. They confront endless medical opinions and receive little guidance in how to decide among them. Given such remarkably difficult choices, it's not surprising that many family caregivers say that for them the grieving process begins before their loved one passes away.",
      'The authors of The End-of-Life Handbook — a psychologist and a medical doctor — have attended the bedsides of countless patients, helping families navigate these difficult choices and the emotional turmoil that accompanies them. Their approach has been to offer practical advice, clearly explaining medical information, treatment options, and practical decisions that must be made; however, they feel it is equally important to stress the opportunities for hope, personal control, and loving family connection that exist right until the end. After such conversations, family members often ask them to recommend books to guide them. Now they have written the perfect one.',
      'The End-of-Life Handbook, recently released from New Harbinger Publications, addresses a true balance of medical, practical, and emotional issues. Written in jargon-free language that is accessible to anyone, it helps families understand the complicated medical system, consider important care decisions, tackle practical issues such as wills and advanced directives, as well as cope with the emotional turmoil and daily stresses that often accompany chronic and life-threatening illness. It also features a foreword by noted palliative care physician Ira Byock, MD, author of Dying Well and The Four Things that Matter Most. Although the book tackles many emotional topics, it carefully avoids the "doom-and-gloom" trap. Instead, it emphasizes the opportunity for hope, inspiration, meaning, and human connection at the end of life.',
